## What is [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)?

> Project Euler is a series of *challenging mathematical/computer programming problems* that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the *inquiring mind* to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Why open source the solutions?

The question is, why not? Solving the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) is so much fun! I **love** :heart_eyes: algorithms and data structures, and the Project Euler problems are like a huge playground :roller_coaster: for that!

I am always happy to learn! So if you have any comments or remarks on the code or the solution strategies, I am open for discussion! :speech_balloon:

## About the code

All solutions:

- Are written in [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org).
- Are annotated with type hints according to [PEP-484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
- Follow the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
